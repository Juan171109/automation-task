# Security Considerations

This document outlines important security considerations for the test automation framework.

## Credentials Management

1. **Never commit credentials to the repository**
   - All credentials should be stored as environment variables or in `cypress.env.json` (which is ignored by git)
   - The `cypress.env.json` file should NEVER be committed to version control

2. **Environment Variables**
   - Local development: Use `cypress.env.json`
   - CI/CD pipelines: Use secrets/environment variables of your CI/CD platform
   - Command line: Pass variables using `CYPRESS_*` prefix

3. **Dedicated Test Accounts**
   - Use dedicated test accounts with limited permissions
   - Rotate credentials periodically
   - Consider using temporary credentials where possible

## CI/CD Security

1. **Protected Variables**
   - Ensure CI/CD variables are protected and masked in logs
   - Restrict access to who can view/edit these variables

2. **Pull Request Protection**
   - Be aware that secrets are not available for pull requests from forks
   - Consider having a separate workflow for PRs from forks that doesn't require credentials

3. **Environment Isolation**
   - Use isolated test environments that don't contain production data

## Local Development Security

1. **Local Environment Files**
   - Keep your `cypress.env.json` file secure
   - Do not share it with others
   - Each developer should have their own copy with their own credentials

2. **Secure Storage**
   - Consider using a password manager to store test credentials
   - Avoid sharing credentials over insecure channels

## Recommended Practices

1. **Run security scans** on your codebase regularly:
   ```bash
   npm audit
   ```

2. **Update dependencies** to their latest secure versions:
   ```bash
   npm update
   ```

3. **Review code** for hardcoded credentials or sensitive information before committing

4. **Report security issues** to the security team immediately

5. **Log responsibly** - ensure sensitive information is not being logged
